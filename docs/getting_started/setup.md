# Set Up

You have two kinds of options to work with Python while learning.

  * Local Machine (Your desktop/laptop)
  * An Online environment (replit and etc.)

## Local Environment

This is a very flexible option. But, it takes some effort to set it up. You can download the installer for your distribution and install it.

https://www.python.org/downloads/

This is usually a straight forward process if you have the sufficient permissions on your local machine (you usually do).

## Online Environment

This is a convenient, portable option that's hosted by some third pary. There are several options.

  * [python.org Shell](https://www.python.org/shell/)
  * [replit](https://replit.com/)
  * [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
  * [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_compiler.asp)

There are more options available and a quick Google search would fetch you more options.

## Validation

If you can run the below command `python -V` and see a similar output with Python version number, you're good to go!

```shell
$ python -V
Python 3.12.1
```

!!! note

    Depending on your environment, sometime the `python` binary might be called `py` (windows) or `python3`. If you don't get success with `python`, you can try the other options and stick with what works in the future.
